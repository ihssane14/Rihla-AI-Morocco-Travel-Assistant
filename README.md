🇲🇦 Rihla – AI-Powered Morocco Travel Assistant

Rihla is an AI-powered travel assistant that helps users explore Morocco by asking natural language questions.
It uses semantic search and AI generation (RAG) to provide accurate and contextual travel recommendations.

🚀 Features

AI chat for Morocco travel questions

Semantic search using vector embeddings

Travel itinerary generator

FastAPI backend

Pinecone vector database

HuggingFace LLM (Mistral)

🧠 How It Works (Architecture)

The user asks a question from the frontend

The backend converts the question into a vector

Pinecone retrieves the most relevant destinations

The AI model generates a response using retrieved data

The answer is returned to the user

This follows the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) approach.
